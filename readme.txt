
Dynamic Image Viewer
Project 3 

Summary:
	Already being familiar with the expo react-native client, I decided to use it for
	my framework in the project. I created a simple image viewer on button press where
	the expected image appears for the user when the button is clicked. The stock images
	were downloaded from unsplash, a popular website for free stock images. 

Installation of Expo Go and the React-Native Client:
	This project assumes that the user has a Windows 10 machine and node.js installed as well
	as an android mobile phone with the expo go app installed.
	In the windows command line under the project directory (../DynamicImageViewer) 
	enter the following:
		npm install
		npm install -g expo-cli
		npx expo start
		- at this point you may need to install/update additional dependencies that will 
		get recommended to the user
		- scan the QR code given with the expo go app on your phone and the app will begin
		deploying for user development

Screenshots of the app can be found at the base directory of the project folder
